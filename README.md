# 🔐 Affine Cipher (C++ Implementation)

A simple and elegant **Affine Cipher** program built in **C++**, featuring encryption and decryption with user-defined keys, clean console UI, and modular arithmetic validation.  
This project demonstrates classical cryptography concepts in a modern, readable C++ style — perfect for students, beginners in cybersecurity, or anyone exploring encryption algorithms.

## 🧠 What is the Affine Cipher?

The **Affine Cipher** is a type of **monoalphabetic substitution cipher** based on modular arithmetic.  
Each letter in the plaintext is transformed into its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a linear function, and then converted back into a letter.

### 📘 Formula

**Encryption:**  
\[
E(x) = (a \times x + b) \mod 26
\]

**Decryption:**  
\[
D(x) = a^{-1} \times (x - b) \mod 26
\]

Where:
- `x` → position of the letter (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
- `a` and `b` → cipher keys
- `a` must be **coprime with 26**
- `a⁻¹` → modular inverse of `a` (so that \( a \times a⁻¹ \equiv 1 \mod 26 \))
